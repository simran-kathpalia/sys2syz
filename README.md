## Overview <!-- omit in toc -->

Sys2Syz is a tool which automates the conversion of syscalls and other Ioctl calls to [syzkaller's](https://github.com/google/syzkaller) representation. This tool was created with a motive of increasing the syscall coverage for leveling up the support of syzkaller for NetBSD. Currently, the tool only supports grammar generation for NetBSD - we plan to add support for other operating systems soon.

The tool supports generation of syzkaller descriptions for NetBSD device driver's ioctl calls. Following steps are involved:

- Extraction of all ioctl commands of a given device driver along with their arguments from the header files. Ioctl commands in NetBSD can be identified with the help of some specific macros(`_IO`, `_IOR`, `_IOW`, `_IOWR`) - ([core/Extractor.py](https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz/blob/gsoc-2020/core/Extractor.py)).
- Preprocessing of the device driver's files using compile_commands.json generated during the setup of tool using Bear - ([core/Bear.py](https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz/blob/gsoc-2020/core/Bear.py))
- XML files are generated by running c2xml on preprocessed device files. This eases the process of fetching the information related to arguments of commands - ([core/C2xml.py](https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz/blob/gsoc-2020/core/C2xml.py))
- Generates descriptions for the ioctl commands and their arguments (builtin-types, arrays, pointers, structures and unions) using the XML files - ([core/Description.py](https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz/blob/gsoc-2020/core/Description.py))

## 3. Installation

Here are the installation instructions for Sys2syz

### 3.1. Dependencies

- [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) setup
- [NetBSD src](https://github.com/NetBSD/src) files

This tool is written in `python3`

### 3.2. Build on Linux

- Clone the repo
 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz.git
 cd sys2syz
 ```
- Install the python dependencies using 

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the setup script

**Note:** This step requires
- NetBSD toolchain. 
- Directory storing compiled modules should be cleaned before performing this step
 ```shell
 ./setup.sh -b <path_to_netbsd_src>
 ```
 
## 4. Usage

 To generate descriptions for a particular device driver(device_driver)/syscall run sys2syz.py:
```shell
python3 sys2syz.py -i <syscall/ioctl> -t <absolute_path_to_device_driver_source> -c compile_commands.json -v -o <target_operating_system>
```
This would generate a ```dev_<device_driver>.txt``` file in the ```out``` directory

## 5. Results

}

```

## 6. Features

- Fetches ioctl calls of a particular device driver.
- Generates a file having syzkaller specific descriptions for fetched ioctl calls.
- Generation of syzkaller descriptions for syscalls.
- Generation of descriptions for functions, passed as arguments to syscalls.
- Detection of flag values for enums


## 7. TODO

Features yet to be implemented:
- Calculating Attributes for structs and unions

This tool is developed by Ayushi Sharma

## 8. SUPPORT FOR FREEBSD

Added support to get descriptions for FreeBSD syscalls and ioctl calls for syzkaller in linux environment. 

To build, run the setup.sh script in a freebsd host(could be a vm) with same path for src as your freebsd src will be in linux and scp the json file from FreeBSD to Linux.
The usage is same as given.

The modifications will soon be integrated with the original repository and will support both NetBSD and FreeBSD.
